In this article i will introduce you the book "linux basics for hackers". I will not dug deeper and just copy-paste this amazing book, I'll use this as a way to memorize better the concepts and core arguments.

## Important therms

+ **Binaries**: this term refers to file that can be executed, like windows .exe files. They generally reside in the *usr/bin* or *user/sbin*  folders (examples: ps, cat, ls, ifconfig, google...).
+ **Linux is case sensitive**: *desktop* is different from *Desktop*
+ **Home**: Every user has a home directory
+ **Root**: administrator privileges
+ **Shell**: an environment and interpreter for running commands on linux. The most used is called *bash*

## Linux Filesystem

 the Linux filesystem is structured as if it were an upside down tree, the top is called *root* (/): here are some of the most important:
+ **/root**: home dir of root user
+ **/etc**:  it generally contains Linux config files
+ **/home**: user home directory
+ **/mnt**: where other filesystem are connected or mounted
+ **/media**: where CD and USB are mounted into the filesystem
+ **/bin**: where binaries reside
+ **/lib**: where I'll find libraries (shared programs that are similar to windows DDLs)

## basic commands
- pwd: (*print working directory*)
+ whoami
+ cd
+ ls
+ man (*command info*)
+ locate (*file location*)
+ whereis (*find a binary*)
+ which (*shows search result query from PATH variable*)
+ find (*the most powerful for searching, You can do a deeper scan with other parameters like creation date*)
+ grep (*can be used as a filter to search for keywords*)
+ ps (*used to find and display info about running processes*)

## Modifying files and directories

+ cat (*generally used for dispaying the contents of a file but it can olso create a file*)
+ touch (*edit or create a file*)
+ mkdir (*create a directory*)
+ cp oldfile   /root/folder/newfile   (*copy a file in a new destination*)
+ mv filename  filename2 (*move command as the same concept as cp, it can also rename a file*)
+ rm (*remove a file*)
+ rmdir (*remove a directory*)

### redirect character (>)
file creation with *cat* example:
```sh
cat > helloworld.txt
#interacrive mode: "hello"
```
when you press enter, Linux will go in *interactive mode*, you can now write content to that file. To exit just press *ctrl-d*

### append character (>>)
```sh
cat >> helloworld.txt
#interactive mode: " world!"
```
You'll be prompted to the interactive mode again

### final result

```sh
cat helloworld.txt
hello world!
```

for overwriting you can use again the  ">" character
